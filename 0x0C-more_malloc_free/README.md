# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` functions. The programs cover various topics related to memory allocation, deallocation, and manipulation.

## List of Programs

- `0-malloc_checked.c`: Allocates memory using `malloc` and checks for allocation failure.
- `1-string_nconcat.c`: Concatenates two strings.
- `2-calloc.c`: Allocates memory for an array and initializes it with zeros.
- `3-array_range.c`: Creates an array of integers with values ranging from `min` to `max`.
- `100-realloc.c`: Reallocates memory for a block of memory.
- `101-mul.c`: Multiplies two positive numbers.

## Getting Started

To compile the programs, use the following format:
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 PROGRAM_FILE.c -o OUTPUT_FILE`


Replace `PROGRAM_FILE.c` with the name of the program file you want to compile and `OUTPUT_FILE` with the desired name for the compiled output file.

## Usage

After compiling a program, you can run it using the following command format:
`./OUTPUT_FILE`


Replace `OUTPUT_FILE` with the name of the compiled output file.
