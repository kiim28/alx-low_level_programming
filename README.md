# Files Overview

This repository contains the following files:

1. `0-putchar.c`: A program that prints the "_putchar" string.
2. `1-alphabet.c`: A program that prints the alphabet.
3. `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: A program that prints the alphabet 10 times.
4. `3-islower.c`: A function that checks if a character is lowercase.
5. `4-isalpha.c`: A function that checks if a character is alphabetic.
6. `5-sign.c`: A function that prints the sign of a number.
7. `6-abs.c`: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
8. `7-print_last_digit.c`: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
9. `8-24_hours.c`: A function that prints every minute of the day.
10. `9-times_table.c`: A function that prints the 9 times table.
11. `10-add.c`: A function that adds two integers.
12. `100-times_table.c`: A function that prints the times table up to a given number.
13. `101-natural.c`: A program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.
14. `102-fibonacci.c`: A program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.
